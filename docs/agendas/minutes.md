Server: We need to start making the api and the backend.

Empty constructors, remove getters and setters for all common classes.

Add functionality to the controllers after 

Need to create all the endpoints.

Store the debts vs calculate on the spot.

We agreed that debts should be persistent.

4 main endpoint paths: Events, expenses, participants, debts


Server-side controllers

Martim: Expenses
Alexander: Events 
Alex: Events 
Maria: Expenses
Radu: Debts
George: Participants

Meeting arranged for this Thursday online and mid-term on Thursday in-person

Store "recently viewed events" information in the config class of the user.

JSON import / export should be endpoints in the api. Simple get request that returns a JSON responses that contains 4 arrays one for each entity.

Need to figure out in terms of our wireframe, which buttons take us where in the GUI, this can be done in the meeting this Thursday

Add Expenses window is missing for now, must do!!

Agreed that event - participant relationship is one-to-many

Milestones and issues are outdated, discuss them on discord, goal to do them by this Thursday either in or just after our meeting.

We agreed to try(!) and achieve functionality by week 6, meaning all basic requirements are met.

Language should be the last basic task that we complete.

Focus on the client working first, then move onto the admin functionality.

REMINDER: Do buddycheck by the 8th of March.
