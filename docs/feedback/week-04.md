# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker

#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda follows the correct template. However, now you could add headings,
indentation to make the document more readable. You could also elaborate further on some agenda point. For example: "Edits on existing classes", could be further elaborated. 
What class? What edits are needed? 


#### Performance of the _Previous_ Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: It would be preferable if you merged your meeting notes into the agenda. There is a good amount of notes.
The notes contain concrete agreements and tasks were assigned to people. Maybe for the work distribution,
also elaborate on what exactly everyone needs to do and how much time it would take. 

To further improve: Only edit the agenda if there were agenda points mentioned that were not initially part of agenda.
Besides that, add actual notes below the agenda, for readability purposes. Make use of formatting and etc.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: All topics were covered. Sometimes you seemed to not be in charge. 
You could work on wrapping the discussions and introducing agenda points. 

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting. The atmosphere was constructive.
You could further engage in the discussions. I would want some team members to speak up more. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient/Good

Feedback: You presented some changes when presenting the work distribution.
The changes are visible from the previous week. You seem to be on track.
Ideally, I would want one person to be appointed (maybe already in the agenda) to give a quick presentation on
ALL new changes to the application. 

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: You seem to have an unbalanced work distribution. Some of you took on more complex tasks and some of you took just a creation of skeleton entities.
It is also reflected in the lines of code per each member. You should try to redistribute the tasks, so that contribution is more equal.
Maybe for the future it would be nice to have a reflection on what went well, how much time your tasks took,
and how could the task distribution improve for the next week.
