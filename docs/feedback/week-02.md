# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker.

#### Agenda

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository on time, it mainly followed the template on brightspace.
Agenda is very readable. 

#### Performance of the _Previous_ Minute Taker

Mark: NOT APPLICABLE FOR THIS WEEK

Feedback: In general make sure that the meeting notes are merged to GitLab,
that the notes are clear, include a section on a tak distribution and agreements discussed
in the meeting, make sure agreements are realistic.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The chair ensured all meeting points were covered and was smoothly transitioning through agenda points.
Good that you started on time. To further improve, you can encourage your team members to speak up during discussions.
Also, I feel like Radoslav was taking on a role of the chair at times. 

Also, you run out of time at the end, so time management could be improved. 

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: You took ownership of the meeting, and most team members were involved in the discussion.
Atmosphere was positive. Everyone's ideas and comments were taken into account. I would like everyone from your group to speak up during the meeting.
So even if you are more on the introverted side, please put effort to voice your opinions.
Additionally, the rest of the group (especially the chair) can motivate the members to speak up.
For example, "Hey, X what do you think about this idea?".

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient ? Not that applicable for this week.

Feedback: Ideally, I want you to present what you have worked on in the previous week.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: Each week I would like you to present what each one of you worked on in the previous week. Currently, it seems like all of you are putting in the effort :)
I like how you discussed the division of tasks that need to be completed.
